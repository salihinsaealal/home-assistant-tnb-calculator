**Calculate your TNB electricity costs in Malaysia**

</div>

A Home Assistant integration to calculate your TNB (Tenaga Nasional Berhad) electricity costs in Malaysia. Supports both Time of Use (ToU) and non-ToU tariffs with accurate monthly billing calculations.

## Features

- **Automatic ToU Detection**: Simply provide your Calendarific API key to enable Time of Use calculations
- **Peak/Off-Peak Splitting**: Integration automatically splits your import energy into peak (2PM-10PM weekdays) and off-peak (10PM-2PM + weekends + holidays) based on TNB schedule
- **Monthly Reset**: Automatically resets on the 1st of each month to match TNB billing cycle
- **Holiday Detection**: Uses Calendarific API to identify Malaysian public holidays for accurate off-peak rates
- **Persistent Storage**: Monthly data survives Home Assistant restarts, integration updates, and delete/re-add operations
- **Smart Meter Reset Handling**: Automatically detects and handles daily/monthly meter resets
- **Verified Accuracy**: Calculations match TNB tariff templates exactly for both ToU and non-ToU

## What's New in v4.0.0

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Configuration & Calibration Overhaul

- **ðŸ”„ Dynamic Configuration Updates**: API key and billing start day changes apply instantly without deleting/re-adding integration
- **ðŸ“… Billing Start Day Status**: New sensor shows `"1 (â†’ 4 next cycle)"` when changes are pending
- **âš¡ Improved Calibration Services**: Distribution options reordered with **Auto** as default, clearer delay information
- **ðŸ”§ Service Fixes**: All calibration services now work correctly with proper refresh handling
- **ðŸ“Š Better UX**: Pending configuration changes visible in sensor attributes and status displays

### Dashboard Usage
1. Install Bubble Card and ApexCharts Card (through HACS or manual resources) and add them under *Settings â†’ Dashboards â†’ Resources*.
2. Copy `dashboards/tnb_calculator_dashboard.yaml` into your dashboard configuration.
3. Either create a dedicated dashboard with the file content or merge its `views:` block with an existing dashboard.
4. Adjust entity IDs only if you renamed the default sensors.

## Configuration

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Search for "TNB Calculator"
4. Follow the setup steps:
   - Select your **import energy sensor** (required)
   - Select your **export energy sensor** (optional, for solar users)
   - **Optional**: Enter your Calendarific API key to enable ToU calculations
   - Get a free API key from [Calendarific.com](https://calendarific.com)

## Requirements

### Required:
- Import energy sensor (kWh) - tracks your total electricity consumption

### Optional:
- Export energy sensor (kWh) - for solar users
- Calendarific API key (free) - for Time of Use calculations

## Sensor Entities

After setup, these sensors will be created:

### Main Sensors
- **Total Cost (ToU/Non-ToU)**: Your monthly TNB bill
- **Import/Export Energy**: Monthly electricity flow in kWh
- **Net Energy**: Net consumption (Import - Export)
- **Predicted Monthly Cost**: Smart forecast with Â±5% tolerance
- **Today Import/Export/Cost**: Real-time daily tracking

### Status & Automation
- **Period Status**: Peak/Off-Peak indicator
- **Usage Tier**: Billing tier (Below 600 kWh, 600-1500 kWh, Above 1500 kWh)
- **Peak Period/Holiday Today**: Binary sensors for automations

### Diagnostic Sensors
- **Prediction Method**: Shows Cost Trend or Hybrid algorithm
- **Configuration Scenario**: Your setup type (e.g., "Import + Export (ToU)")
- **Storage Health**: Data persistence status
- **Validation Status**: Configuration health check

### Detailed Cost Breakdown (ToU only)
- Generation Charge Peak/Off Peak, Capacity, Network, Service Tax
- KWTBB Charge, NEM Rebates, Rate Sensors
