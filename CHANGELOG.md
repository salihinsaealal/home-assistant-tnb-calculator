# Changelog

All notable changes to TNB Calculator will be documented in this file.

## [4.4.1] - 2025-12-13

### Added
- **AFA Optimization & Sweet-Spot Sensors**
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_ideal_import_kwh` – ideal monthly import (gross kWh) that minimises total bill.
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_savings_if_ideal_kwh` – potential MYR savings if usage moves towards ideal import.
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_optimization_savings` – compares current bill vs hypothetical 600 kWh bill.
  - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_weird_zone` – ON when more usage towards 600 kWh actually lowers the bill.
  - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_value_zone` – ON when extra kWh up to 600 are very cheap per kWh (good value).
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_explanation` – short zone state with full explanation in attributes.

### Improved
- Updated the prebuilt dashboard with an **AFA Optimization** section.
- README updated with automation examples and cleaner release notes formatting.

## [4.4.0b2] - 2025-12-11 (Beta)

### Improved
- **AFA Explanation Sensor UX**
  - Sensor state now shows a short zone label (`normal`, `weird`, `value`, `above_threshold`).
  - Full human-readable explanation moved into an `explanation` attribute.
  - Keeps the device sensor list clean while retaining detailed guidance for dashboards.

- **Dashboard: AFA Optimization Section**
  - Added a dedicated card in `dashboards/tnb_calculator_dashboard.yaml` for:
    - `sensor.tnb_calculator_ideal_import_kwh`
    - `sensor.tnb_calculator_savings_if_ideal_kwh`
    - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_optimization_savings`
    - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_explanation`
    - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_weird_zone`
    - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_value_zone`

- **Documentation & Automations**
  - README now documents the AFA optimization sensors and adds example automations for:
    - High bill alert
    - AFA weird zone alert
    - AFA value zone alert
    - Monthly summary including AFA zone.

## [4.4.0b1] - 2025-12-11 (Beta)

### Added
- **AFA Optimization & Sweet-Spot Sensors**
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_ideal_import_kwh` – ideal monthly import (gross kWh) that minimises total bill.
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_savings_if_ideal_kwh` – potential MYR savings if usage moves towards ideal import.
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_optimization_savings` – compares current bill vs hypothetical 600 kWh bill.
  - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_weird_zone` – ON when more usage towards 600 kWh actually lowers the bill.
  - `binary_sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_value_zone` – ON when extra kWh up to 600 are very cheap per kWh (good value).
  - `sensor.tnb_calculator_afa_explanation` – human-readable explanation of the current AFA situation (normal/weird/value/above 600 kWh).

### Notes
- All new sensors are **read-only optimizations** based on existing monthly import/export and tariff data.
- They do not alter calculations for existing sensors; they only provide guidance for optimising usage around the 600 kWh AFA threshold.

## [4.0.1] - 2025-10-09

### Fixed
- **Service UI Default**: `adjust_import_energy_values` distribution now correctly defaults to "Auto" instead of "Proportional"

---

## [4.0.0] - 2025-10-09

### 🎉 Major Release - Configuration & Calibration Overhaul

This major version brings significant improvements to configuration management, calibration workflows, and billing cycle customization.

### Added
- **🔄 Dynamic Configuration Updates**: API key and billing start day changes now apply immediately without requiring integration deletion/re-add
  - Options flow properly merges with config entry data
  - Coordinator refreshes configuration on every update cycle
  - ToU mode activates instantly when API key is added via reconfigure
- **📅 Billing Start Day Status Sensor**: New `sensor.tnb_calculator_billing_start_day_status` displays active billing day with pending changes
  - Shows format: `"1 (→ 4 next cycle)"` when a change is staged
  - Exposes `billing_start_day_active`, `billing_start_day_configured`, and `billing_start_day_pending` attributes
  - Pending changes activate at the next billing cycle boundary
- **⚡ Improved Calibration Services**: Enhanced user experience for energy value adjustments
  - Distribution options reordered: Auto → Peak Only → Off-Peak Only → Proportional → Manual
  - Default distribution changed to "Auto" (detects based on current time)
  - Simplified service descriptions with clear delay information
  - All services now use `async_refresh()` for consistency

### Improved
- **🔧 Service Registration**: Fixed `async_request_refresh()` → `async_refresh()` in reset_storage service
- **📊 Calibration Workflow**: 
  - Values save to storage immediately
  - Sensor display updates on next coordinator refresh (~5 minutes)
  - Users informed: "Values update immediately in storage but sensor display has a delay. For instant sensor refresh, reload the integration."
- **🎯 Configuration Persistence**: Billing start day and API key changes persist across integration reloads
- **📝 Service UI Polish**: 
  - Cleaner field descriptions
  - "Proportional" now labeled as "split by current peak/off-peak ratio"
  - Removed verbose examples from descriptions

### Fixed
- **🐛 Service UI Not Showing**: Corrected method call preventing service registration from completing
- **🔄 ToU Mode Not Updating**: Fixed coordinator not detecting API key additions after initial setup
- **📅 Billing Day Visibility**: Pending billing start day changes now surface in both number entity attributes and dedicated status sensor

### Technical Changes
- Merged `entry.data` and `entry.options` in `async_setup_entry()` for unified configuration
- Added `async_reload_entry()` update listener for automatic reload on options changes
- Coordinator now updates `_import_entity`, `_export_entity`, `_api_key`, and `_billing_start_day` on every refresh
- Billing number entity displays active day while exposing configured/pending values in attributes
- New `TNBBillingStartDayStatusSensor` class for formatted billing day status display

### Breaking Changes
- None - All changes are backward compatible

---

## [3.7.3b1] - 2025-10-07 (Beta)

### Added
- **Prediction Method Sensor**: New diagnostic sensor showing which prediction algorithm is active (Cost Trend or Hybrid).
- **Configuration Scenario Sensor**: New diagnostic sensor displaying setup type (Import Only, Import+Export, ToU, Non-ToU).

### Improved
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Switched from kWh projection to direct cost averaging for more realistic monthly forecasts.
  - Formula: `(current_cost / days_elapsed) × days_in_month ± 5%`
  - Example: RM 3.00 over 4 days = RM 0.75/day × 30 = RM 22.50 ± RM 1.13
  - Eliminates inflated predictions on early days of the month.
- **Prediction Attributes**: Added `prediction_tolerance`, `prediction_range_min`, and `prediction_range_max` to show confidence bounds.

### Fixed
- **Optional Config Inputs**: Config flow now properly accepts blank export sensors and Calendarific API keys without validation errors.

## [3.7.2] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- Updated `hacs.json` metadata and version strings to align with HACS default-store requirements.

### Added
- **Bubble Dashboard Template**: New `dashboards/tnb_calculator_dashboard.yaml` featuring Bubble Card quick metrics and ApexCharts graphs.

### Improved
- **Documentation**: README and info cards now explain how to import the dashboard as a dedicated view or merge it into existing dashboards.

### Added
- **Holiday Diagnostics**: `sensor.tnb_cached_holidays_count` now exposes `cached_holidays` and `cached_holidays_last_fetch` attributes listing every cached date for quick cross-checking.

## [3.6.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- **Validation Status Sensor**: New diagnostic sensor reporting configuration issues detected at runtime.

### Improved
- **Config Flow Guardrails**: Import/export entities now validated for device class, state class, units, and numeric state inputs before setup.
- **Calendarific API Checks**: Setup and options flows provide specific errors for invalid keys, rate limits, timeouts, or connectivity issues.
- **Runtime Diagnostics**: Coordinator logs validation warnings and exposes them via the `validation_status` sensor.

### Fixed
- **Graceful Sensor Handling**: Coordinator no longer silently zeroes bad readings— issues are flagged for visibility.

## [3.5.1] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **Diagnostic Sensors**: Resolved Home Assistant entity registry error caused by using string `entity_category` values. Diagnostic sensors are now registered using `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC` and appear correctly after reload.
