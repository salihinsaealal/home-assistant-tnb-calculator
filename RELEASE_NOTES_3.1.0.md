# Release Notes - Version 3.1.0

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### ToU Cost Calculation Fix
**Critical bug fixed**: ToU cost was incorrectly showing lower than non-ToU during peak hours.

**Root Cause**: 
- Export energy allocation was using `export_peak = import_peak` without checking actual export
- When `export_total = 0` but `import_peak = 0.789`, it created phantom export of 0.789 kWh
- This generated incorrect NEM rebates, artificially lowering ToU cost

**Solution**:
```python
# Before (WRONG):
export_peak = import_peak
export_offpeak = export_total - export_peak  # Could be negative!

# After (CORRECT):
export_peak = min(import_peak, export_total)
export_offpeak = export_total - export_peak
```

**Impact**: ToU cost now correctly shows higher than non-ToU during peak hours, as expected.

## üöÄ Improvements

### 1. Robust Holiday Caching with Daily Refresh

**Problem**: 
- Holiday cache was only in memory (lost on restart)
- Only fetched when date not in cache (no retry on failure)
- If first fetch failed, never retried

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **Daily API refresh**: Fetches entire year once per 24 hours
- ‚úÖ **Persistent storage**: Holiday cache saved to disk
- ‚úÖ **Automatic retry**: If previous fetch failed, retries next day
- ‚úÖ **Graceful fallback**: Uses cached data if API unavailable

**API Usage**: ~30 calls/month (3% of free tier quota)

**Benefits**:
- More reliable holiday detection
- Survives Home Assistant restarts
- Automatic recovery from API failures

### 2. Data Persistence Across Delete/Re-add

**Problem**:
- Storage used `entry_id` which changes when integration is deleted and re-added
- All monthly data lost when reconfiguring

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **Stable storage identifier**: Uses import entity ID instead of entry_id
- ‚úÖ **Automatic migration**: Existing users' data migrated seamlessly
- ‚úÖ **Delete-safe**: Data survives integration delete/re-add operations

**Example**:
```
Old: .storage/tnb_calculator_monthly_data_abc123  (entry_id)
New: .storage/tnb_calculator_monthly_data_electricity_import_total  (entity-based)
```

**Benefits**:
- Reconfigure integration without losing data
- More reliable data preservation
- Easier troubleshooting and migration

## üìù Technical Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **sensor.py**
   - Fixed export allocation logic in `_calculate_tou_costs()`
   - Added `_fetch_holidays_if_needed()` for daily API refresh
   - Updated `_is_holiday()` to use cached data
   - Changed storage identifier to use import entity
   - Added automatic migration from old storage format
   - Updated storage format to include holiday cache and timestamp

2. **manifest.json**
   - Version bumped to 3.1.0

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added comprehensive release notes

### Storage Format Update:
```json
{
  "monthly_data": {
    "month": 10,
    "year": 2025,
    "import_total": 125.5,
    "export_total": 45.2,
    "import_peak": 75.3,
    "import_offpeak": 50.2,
    "import_last": 5432.1,
    "export_last": 1234.5
  },
  "holiday_cache": {
    "2025-01-01": true,
    "2025-08-31": true,
    ...
  },
  "last_holiday_fetch": "2025-10-01T08:15:30+08:00"
}
```

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:
- **Automatic migration** on first restart after update
- No manual action required
- Check logs for: `Successfully migrated data from old storage`
- Old storage file kept as backup

### What to Expect:
1. First restart: Data migrated to new storage location
2. Holiday cache rebuilt from API (if 24h passed)
3. All sensor values preserved
4. No configuration changes needed

---

## üìä Testing Performed

### Test Cases:
1. ‚úÖ ToU cost higher than non-ToU during peak hours
2. ‚úÖ ToU cost lower than non-ToU during off-peak hours
3. ‚úÖ Zero export doesn't create phantom rebates
4. ‚úÖ Holiday cache persists across restarts
5. ‚úÖ Daily API refresh works correctly
6. ‚úÖ Data migration from old storage format
7. ‚úÖ Delete/re-add preserves data

### Test Data:
```
Input:
- Import Peak: 0.789 kWh
- Import Off-Peak: 0.0 kWh
- Export: 0.0 kWh
- Period: Peak (Weekday 2PM-10PM)

Results:
- Non-ToU Cost: 0.15 RM
- ToU Cost: 0.17 RM ‚úì (correctly higher)
```

## üéØ Summary

This release focuses on **reliability and correctness**:
- Fixed critical ToU calculation bug
- Improved holiday caching robustness
- Enhanced data persistence across configuration changes
- Better user experience with automatic migration

**Recommended for all users** - especially those using ToU tariff.
